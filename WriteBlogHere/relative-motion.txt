You're only worried about falling behind if you're not moving ahead?<br>
That is an....<i>interesting</i> concept?<br>
If me thinking I am being mediocre and wont get anywhere in life is linked to me not doing work for that day why should I be worried?<br>
That means my brain is punishing me for not doing enough to feel accomplished for that day?<br>
Why should I feel pathetic for that? I should feel happy?<br>
