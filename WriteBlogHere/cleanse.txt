I have decided to go on a digital detox following the incredibly deteriorating status of my focus and future.<br>
That means No discord, no instagram, no twitter, even no whatsapp for the next month or so.<br>
I might keep whatsapp for important texts and such but apart from that nothing.<br>
Following that I have no youtube, no games, no commitments to other people.<br><br>
Given all of these, what do I focus on instead?<br>
Mostly getting ahead in college and grinding the tech stack.<br>
I wish I had done this before in JEE prep but I didnt but hey that doesnt matter now.<br>
All I hope to achieve at the end of these set of events is focus.
