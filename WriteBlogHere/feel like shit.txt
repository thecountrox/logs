wasted oppourtunities suck.<br>
Especially time constrained ones, wherin you dont realise what you want untill its too late.<br>
The sooner you know what your end goal is, the better.<br>
I hope the pain of this is enough to ensure two things<br>
<ol type="a">
    <li>I remember the pain of missing out on something remarkable.</li>
    <li>I try to gain complete focus and control</li>
</ol><br>
I guess the rule of thumb is to not have any regrets, so we say <i>"welp thats unfortunate"</i> and do what we can.
<br><br>
Taking Full Control of your own mind is a tough thing and is a problem as old as time.<br>
It takes time and it's the end goal of being in complete control.<br>
I hope I can keep pushing. I hope.
