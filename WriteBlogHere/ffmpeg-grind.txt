My first post exams project is going to be an ffmpeg collection which includes the following: 

## Video Based:
+ Speed Video
+ Trim Video from front
+ Trim Video from back
+ Video to GIF
+ lossless/minimal loss conversions to different types
+ remove audio from video (separate into pure audio file + pure video file) 
+ add audio to video (sync)
+ Convert video into image frames as output 
+ crop video

## Audio Based:
+ Trim audio from start
+ Trim audio from end
+ lossless/minimal conversion of different types

I will implement these swagly 

Before I do these I need to grind ffmpeg documentation which is what ill be doing for the next few days.
