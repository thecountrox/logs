The title is fancy but the concept is not, its just that <i>"tImE wItH oUt wOrK pRoPeRlY sPaCeD"</i> doesnt sound catchy.<br>
Essentially the more time you have to a deadline but you haven't broken down the task to its basics and allotted slots to that time,<br>
Higher the chances that you will waste the time.<br>
<br>
tldr; breakdown your tasks and alot them to time slot of your day.<br>
