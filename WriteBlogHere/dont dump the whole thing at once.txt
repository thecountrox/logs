Right now I load all divs at once which is kinda fine now because I have so little content,<br>
but after a while that gets stuffy/HTML becomes too big.<br>
What if I selectively loaded from my array on scroll?<br>
I think that would be a cool way to make a fake infinite scroll.<br>
Might implement that later.<br>
When the webpage takes too long to load.
