The reason I made this logger was too see how my focus waivers and I think I see it now, over a course of 1 week or 2 weeks, <br>
I loose all progress/idea I have over a goal/thing I have to achieve or is important. More importantly I think its because<br>
I dont remind myself of what progress I had. Telling I will do it later is one thing but then I should also remember to write that
down somewhere.<br> Maybe Ive been zombie for the last week or so because I've been doing things aimlessly but atleast the 
realisation period was not that long.<br><br>Gotta get focus kek
