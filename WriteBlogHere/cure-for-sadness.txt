The way you address bummed outness or blatant sadness to put it simply is to go at it from the root.
For me it's the _mediocrity_ I've developed over the past 2 years. 
The only logical way to get rid of it is to dispose all methods of temporary dopamine and focus on fulfilling my drive.

*Every day feels like suffering* but I hope that at end of it, I attain some satisfaction.
I will most likely feel sad for the many months to come but I hope I can transform to the person of my aspirations or atleast
someone on the path to those aspirations.
