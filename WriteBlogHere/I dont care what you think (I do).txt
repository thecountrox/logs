Independent thinking is hard, not in the sense that it's some impossible mountain to climb,<br>
rather is like navigating unknown terrain except if you use a map, you're considered a sheep<br>
So that made me go on an overthinking quest as to what really is being an <ul>independent</ul> thinker?<br><br>
To keep it short I came to the conclusion that an independent thinker isnt an asshole who shuts down all other not original thoughts<br>
rather is someone who can process large levels of data fed to them and then draw something from it. Which is ironic because an independent thinker is just an outcome of what information he or she is fed. That basically means that there is no one school of thought neither is there any seperate school of thought. But there is one thing for sure, an independent thinker doesnt ignore their surroundings while formatting their opinions, maybe that is the most fundamental mark of an independent, the one who looks all around him and then formats an opinion rather than ignore his surroundings and go with the ones fed by others.<br><br>
