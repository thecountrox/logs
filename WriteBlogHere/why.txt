Why did I make this in the first place even ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”? <br>
Answer: Im not really sure, I think it's because I want to look smart 
by making something from scratch.
<br>
Another reason might be complete control, with this I can modify anything I want and have full control<br>
granted that might make the starting page look a bit bad now but atleast I know that with 3 clicks I can change the css<br>
It's also because logginng thoughts is something really interesting, your state of mind differs constantly, granted not rashly 
rather continously but that's just all the more reason to note it down, you barely notice how you change mentally so this way you can 
see what your thought process was like.
