<i>*watches one india in pixels video*</i><br>
He is good, makes me wonder what I am doing with my life?<br>
But apparently no one is suppossed to know what they are doing?<br>
So for now I will accept that what I want to do is get to a state where I can decide and do whatever I want<br>
<sup>eerie-ly similar to the entire <i>"jUsT cRaCk jEe lIfE wIlL bE sEt aFtEr tHaT"</i></sup><br><br>
But maybe I already know what I want to do, atleast for the next few years?<br>
You cannot know what you're going to do for the rest of your life that is for sure.<br>
But maybe just maybe you can take some inspiration from those around you to live a better tomorrow for everyone else.
