I need to figure out a way to synch this from multiple sources, <br>
The structure of multiple sources are similar but not <b>exact<b>.
The number of streams is not limited and can grow.<br>
Each stream ought to have a native format<br> 
At regular (or irregular) intervals a small chunk of data is taken from central repo and <u>synchronised</u>.
