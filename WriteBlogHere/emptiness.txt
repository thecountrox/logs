I dont know whether to cry or laugh, it feels as if tho the what next part of my life is already dead.<br>
Not because I committed some henious crime or destroyed my reputation.<br>It's because I got average board marks lol<br>
Dont know how long I can keep myself motivated about the future if everything about the mediocre 2 years of 11th and 12th come to 
haunt me from the past.<br><br>Ive started my detox today from tech but I find myself going back to youtube, not to be a zombie,<br>
rather to drown away the pain in mindless youtube skits and fun facts.<br><br>I need a grasp of life.
