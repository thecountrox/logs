6 years ago, I was competitive.<br>
That trait stayed with me until pre-covid 2 years ago with debates, MUNs and quizzes.<br>
Somewhere along the line, I stopped myself from trying to push myself.<br><br>
This I think might have been a mistake, I should restart and stop flushing out the negativity and channel it instead<br>
This post might be a declaration that leads to something new.<br>
Maybe I want to be really, really, really good at a few things.<br>
Best in the world? Maybe? I just want to stop feeling like a mediocre, lazy piece of shit.
