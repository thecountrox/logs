It took me way longer than it had to for me to implement edit (almost 4 hrs)<br>
But I finally did it. The reason it took taht long was due to me not finalizing what way I wanted to tackle this<br>
and how I actually wrote the inital dom appender, and I also wanted it to be on par with what was there in the blog<br>
So that took a while. Happy with the final result tho.<br>
