<i>
I'm going back to 505<br>
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
With your hands between your thighs<br><br>

But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br>
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise<br>
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
