How do I get ahead when I'm behind without disowning, pivoting or ignoring my issues?<br>
I know that the answer is to "work harder than everyone else", its just how do I go about doing it?<br>
Why the fuck am I lazy now? This is stupid, why the fuck am I sad now?<br>
Because I didnt get into a college? Like dude so what? Move. On.<br>
nvm I read something that messed with my head.<br>
I need to cut off negativity, <b>now</b>.
